Today I started my very first knitting project! I decided to make a simple scarf using basic garter stitch. 

## Materials Used

- **Yarn**: Medium weight acrylic yarn in forest green
- **Needles**: Size 8 (5mm) straight needles
- **Pattern**: Simple garter stitch (knit every row)

## What I Learned

Starting out was more challenging than I expected. Casting on took me several attempts to get right, but I watched a few YouTube tutorials and eventually got the hang of it. The key is to:

1. Keep consistent tension
2. Don't pull too tight
3. Practice makes perfect!

## Progress So Far

I've completed about 6 inches of the scarf. It's not perfect - I can see where I dropped a stitch early on - but I'm proud of my progress. The rhythm of knitting is actually quite meditative.

## Next Steps

- Continue working on the scarf (goal: 60 inches total)
- Learn how to bind off properly
- Maybe try a different stitch pattern once I'm more confident

Can't wait to see the finished product!
