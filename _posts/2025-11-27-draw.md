# Draw

No joke. This one is as simple as draw something. No special equipment is necessary. No special tools. No special location. Just sit down (or stand, I won't judge) and draw. Draw what's in front of you, draw from your mind. It doesn't matter. Just try your best to get down on paper whatever you are trying to as acurately as you can see it in your mind. 

- Look at it.
- Draw it.
- Look at it again.
- Correct your drawing.

Each time you do it, you'll get a bit better[^1]. Embrace the failures and keep going. You can always use the drawings as kindling for the fire.

This will help with designing future craft projects even if you don't go at drawing as a primary output.

[^1]: On average. Not every drawing will be better than the last. This is about learning to use your tools and your eyes and your hands.
