# [Woodturning patterns by David Heim](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Woodturning-Patterns/dp/1950934179)

David Heim has written a book with over 80 patterns for wood turning. 

The book is divided into sections on:
- Kitchenware
- Playthings and ornaments
- Knobs and finials
- Shop and garden
- Lamps and candlesticks
- Bowls, vases and platters

Each section gives several examples which can be photocopied and enlarged giving a pattern that can be followed when standing at the lathe.

Many designs also include small tips on the type of wood, techniques that can make turning the item easier etc.

While you may not want to exactly copy any of the designs in the book, it's useful for inspriation and a good one to flick through while you have a break from the lathe for a coffee and plan your next item.
