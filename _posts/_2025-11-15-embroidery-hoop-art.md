I've always admired embroidery hoop art and finally decided to create my own piece featuring wildflowers.

## Project Details

This project combined several embroidery techniques to create a nature-inspired wall hanging.

### Supplies

- 8-inch wooden embroidery hoop
- Cotton fabric (cream colored)
- Embroidery floss in various colors (pinks, purples, greens, yellows)
- Embroidery needles
- Water-soluble fabric marker
- Scissors

### Techniques Used

I practiced several different stitches for this project:

- **Lazy daisy stitch** for flower petals
- **French knots** for flower centers
- **Stem stitch** for stems and branches
- **Satin stitch** for leaves

## Design Process

I sketched my design freehand using a water-soluble marker. The composition features:

- Purple lavender sprigs
- Yellow wildflowers
- Pink cosmos flowers  
- Green foliage throughout

## Challenges

The hardest part was keeping my tension consistent, especially with the satin stitch. Some of my leaves came out a bit wonky, but that adds to the handmade charm!

## Final Thoughts

This piece took me about 8 hours over three days. Now it's hanging in my living room and I get compliments every time someone visits. Already planning my next hoop art project - maybe something with geometric patterns!
